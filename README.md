# DardenDataScience_FinalProjectCode
Created for our final Darden (UVA School of Business) Data Science project 

The original dataset was created and cleaned by Felipe Almansa Iurif

The code involved creating dummy variables, using a sentiment dictionary, and cleaning the dataset using a word lemmatizer. After words, we created three different models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, & XGBoost. The final calculations also involved using an ensemble model that mixed the results fo the XGBoost and Random Forest models.
